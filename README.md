Example Clang plugins - based on **Clang 10**

**clang-tutor** is a collection of self-contained reference Clang plugins. It's a
tutorial that targets novice and aspiring Clang developers. Key features:
  * **Complete** - includes `CMake` build scripts, LIT tests and CI set-up
  * **Out of source** - builds against a binary Clang/LLVM installation (no
    need to build Clang from sources)
  * **Modern** - based on the latest version of Clang/LLVM (and updated with
    every release)

Status
======
**Work in progress**

Everything builds fine and all tests pass. This project is under active
development. More content to be added soon.

Building & Testing
===================
You can build **clang-tutor** (and all the provided plugins) as follows:
```bash
cd <build/dir>
cmake -DCT_LLVM_INSTALL_DIR=<installation/dir/of/llvm/10> <source/dir/clang-tutor>
make
```

The `CT_LLVM_INSTALL_DIR` variable should be set to the root of either the
installation or build directory of LLVM 10. It is used to locate the
corresponding `LLVMConfig.cmake` script that is used to set the include and
library paths.

In order to run the tests, you need to install **llvm-lit** (aka **lit**). It's
not bundled with LLVM 10 packages, but you can install it with **pip**:
```bash
# Install lit - note that this installs lit globally
pip install lit
```
Running the tests is as simple as:
```bash
$ lit <build_dir>/test
```
Voil√†! You should see all tests passing.
