Example Clang plugins - based on **Clang 10**

**clang-tutor** is a collection of self-contained reference Clang plugins. It's a
tutorial that targets novice and aspiring Clang developers. Key features:

  * **Modern** - based on the latest version of Clang/LLVM (and updated with
    every release)
  * **Complete** - includes build scripts, LIT tests and CI set-up
  * **Out of tree** - builds against a binary Clang/LLVM installation (no
    need to build Clang/LLVM from sources)

**Work in progress**

Everything builds fine and all tests pass. This project is under active
development. More content to be added soon.

HelloWorld
==========
The **HelloWorld** plugin from
[HelloWorld.cpp](https://github.com/banach-space/clang-tutor/blob/master/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.cpp)
is a self-contained *reference example*. The corresponding
[CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/banach-space/clang-tutor/blob/master/HelloWorld/CMakeLists.txt)
implements the minimum set-up for an out-of-tree plugin.

**HelloWorld** extracts some interesting information from the input
_translation unit_. It visits all [C++ record
declarations](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/release/10.x/clang/include/clang/AST/DeclCXX.h#L253)
(more specifically class, struct and union declarations) and counts them.
Recall that translation unit consists of the input source file and all the
header files that it includes (directly or indirectly).

**HelloWorld** prints the results on a file by file
basis, i.e. separately for every header file that has been included. It visits
_all_ declarations - including the ones in header files included by other
header files. This may lead to some surprising results!

You can build and run **HelloWorld** like this:

```bash
# Build the plugin
export LLVM_DIR=<installation/dir/of/clang/10>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCT_LLVM_INSTALL_DIR=$LLVM_DIR <source/dir/clang/tutor>/HelloWorld/
make
# Run the plugin
$LLVM_DIR/bin/clang -cc1 -load libHelloWorld.dylib -plugin hello-world test/HelloWorld-basic.cpp
```

You should see the following output:

```
# Expected output
(clang-tutor) file: <source/dir/clang/tutor>/test/HelloWorld-basic.cpp
(clang-tutor)  count: 3
```

### How To Analyze STL Headers
In order to see what happens with multiple _indirectly_ included header files,
you can run **HelloWorld** on one of the header files from the [Standard
Template Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library). For
example, you can use the following C++ file that simply includes `vector.h`:

```cpp
// file.cpp
#include <vector>
```

When running a Clang plugin on a C++ file that includes headers from STL, it is
easier to run it with `clang++` (rather than `clang -cc1`) like this:

```bash
$LLVM_DIR/bin/clang++ -c -Xclang -load -Xclang libHelloWorld.dylib -Xclang -plugin -Xclang hello-world file.cpp
```

This way you can be confident that all the necessary include paths (required to
locate STL headers) are automatically added. For the above input file,
**HelloWorld** will print:

* an overview of _all_ header files included when using `#include <vector>`,
  and
* the number of C++ records declared in each.


Note that there are no explicit declarations in `file.cpp` and only one header
file is included. However, the output on my system consists of 37 header files
(one of which contains 371 declarations). Note that the actual output depends
on your host OS, the C++ standard library implementation and its version. Your
results are likely to be different.

Building & Testing
===================
You can build **clang-tutor** (and all the provided plugins) as follows:
```bash
cd <build/dir>
cmake -DCT_LLVM_INSTALL_DIR=<installation/dir/of/clang/10> <source/dir/clang-tutor>
make
```

The `CT_LLVM_INSTALL_DIR` variable should be set to the root of either the
installation or build directory of Clang 10. It is used to locate the
corresponding `LLVMConfig.cmake` script that is used to set the include and
library paths.

In order to run the tests, you need to install **llvm-lit** (aka **lit**). It's
not bundled with LLVM 10 packages, but you can install it with **pip**:
```bash
# Install lit - note that this installs lit globally
pip install lit
```
Running the tests is as simple as:
```bash
$ lit <build_dir>/test
```
Voil√†! You should see all tests passing.

Overview of The Plugins
=======================
   * [**HelloWorld**](#helloworld) - counts the number of class, struct and
     union declarations in the input translation unit
   * [**LACommenter**](#lacommenter) - adds comments to literal arguments
     in functions calls
   * [**CodeStyleChecker**](#codestylechecker) - issue a warning if the input
     file does not follow one of [LLVM's coding
     style guidelines](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html#name-types-functions-variables-and-enumerators-properly)
   * [**Obfuscator**](#obfuscator) - obfuscates integer addition and
     subtraction

Once you've [built](#build-instructions) this project, you can experiment with
every plugin separately. All plugins take C and C++ files as input.  All
plugins, except for [**HelloWorld**](#helloworld), are described below.

## LACommenter
The **LACommenter** (Literal Argument Commenter) plugin will comment literal
arguments in function calls. For example, in the following input code:

```c
extern void foo(int some_arg);

void bar() {
  foo(123);
}
```

**LACommenter** will decorate the invocation of `foo`  as follows:

```c
extern void foo(int some_arg);

void bar() {
  foo(/*some_arg=*/123);
}
```

This commenting style follows LLVM's [oficial guidelines](
https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html#comment-formatting). **LACommenter**
will comment character, integer, floating point, boolean and string literal
arguments.

This plugin is based on a similar example from a
[presentation](https://s3.amazonaws.com/connect.linaro.org/yvr18/presentations/yvr18-223.pdf)
by Peter Smith.

### Run the plugin

```bash
$LLVM_DIR/bin/clang -cc1 -load lib/libLACommenter.dylib -plugin LAC test/LACLong.cpp
```

### Run the plugin through `lacommenter`

```bash
bin/lacommenter test/LACLong.cpp
```

## CodeStyleChecker
This plugin demonstrates how to use Clang's
[DiagnosticEngine](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/release/10.x/clang/include/clang/Basic/Diagnostic.h#L149)
to generate custom compiler warnings.  Essentially, **CodeStyleChecker** checks
whether names of classes, functions and variables in the input translation unit
adhere to LLVM's [style
guide](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html#name-types-functions-variables-and-enumerators-properly).
If not, a warning is printed. For every warning, **CodeStyleChecker** generates
a suggestion that would fix the corresponding issue. This is done with the
[FixItHint](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/release/10.x/clang/include/clang/Basic/Diagnostic.h#L66)
API.
[SourceLocation](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/release/10.x/clang/include/clang/Basic/SourceLocation.h#L86)
API is used to generate valid source location.

**CodeStyleChecker** is robust enough to cope with complex examples like
`vector.h` from STL, yet the actual implementation is fairly compact. For
example, it can correctly analyze names expanded from macros and knows that it
should ignore [user-defined conversion
operators](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/cast_operator).


### Run the plugin
Let's test **CodeStyleCheker** on the following file:

```cpp
// file.cpp
class clangTutor_BadName;
```

The name of the class doesn't follow LLVM's coding guide and
**CodeStyleChecker** indeed captures that:

```bash
$LLVM_DIR/bin/clang -cc1 -fcolor-diagnostics -load libCodeStyleChecker.dylib -plugin code-style-checker file.cpp
file.cpp:2:7: warning: Type and variable names should start with upper-case letter
class clangTutor_BadName;
      ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      ClangTutor_BadName
file.cpp:2:17: warning: `_` in names is not allowed
class clangTutor_BadName;
      ~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~
      clangTutorBadName
2 warnings generated.
```

There are two warnings generated as two rules have been violated. Alongside
every warning, a suggestion (i.e. a `FixItHint`) that would make the
corresponding warning go away. Note that **CodeStyleChecker** also supplements
the warnings with correct source code information.

`-fcolor-diagnostics` above instructs Clang to generate color output
(unfortunately Markdown doesn't render the colors here).

## Obfuscator
The **Obfuscator** plugin will rewrite integer addition and subtraction
according to the following formulae:

```
a + b == (a ^ b) + 2 * (a & b)
a - b == (a + ~b) + 1
```

The above transformations are often used in code obfuscation. You may also know
them from [Hacker's
Delight](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hackers-Delight-Henry-S-Warren/dp/0201914654).

The plugin runs twice over the input file. First it scans for integer
additions. If any are found, the input file is updated and printed to stdout.
If there are no integer additions, there is no output. Similar logic is
implemented for integer subtraction.

Similar code transformations are possible at the [LLVM
IR](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html) level. In particular, see
[MBAsub](https://github.com/banach-space/llvm-tutor#mbasub) and
[MBAAdd](https://github.com/banach-space/llvm-tutor#mbaadd) in
[**llvm-tutor**](https://github.com/banach-space/llvm-tutor).

### Run the plugin
Lets use the following file as our input:

```c
int foo(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

You can run the plugin like this:

```bash
$LLVM_DIR/bin/clang -cc1 -load lib/libObfuscator.dylib -plugin Obfuscator input.cpp
```

You should see the following output on your screen.

```c
int foo(int a, int b) {
  return (a ^ b) + 2 * (a & b);
}
```
