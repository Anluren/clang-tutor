Example Clang plugins - based on **Clang 10**

**clang-tutor** is a collection of self-contained reference Clang plugins. It's a
tutorial that targets novice and aspiring Clang developers. Key features:
  * **Complete** - includes `CMake` build scripts, LIT tests and CI set-up
  * **Out of source** - builds against a binary Clang/LLVM installation (no
    need to build Clang from sources)
  * **Modern** - based on the latest version of Clang/LLVM (and updated with
    every release)

Status
======
**Work in progress**

Everything builds fine and all tests pass. This project is under active
development. More content to be added soon.

HelloWorld
==========
The **HelloWorld** plugin from
[HelloWorld.cpp](https://github.com/banach-space/clang-tutor/blob/master/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.cpp)
is a self-contained *reference example*. The corresponding
[CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/banach-space/clang-tutor/blob/master/HelloWorld/CMakeLists.txt)
implements the minimum set-up for an out-of-tree plugin.

For every class declared in the input file, **HelloWord** prints its name,
location of the declaration and the number of its base classes. You can build
it like this:

```bash
export LLVM_DIR=<installation/dir/of/clang/10>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCT_LLVM_INSTALL_DIR=$LLVM_DIR <source/dir/clang/tutor>/HelloWorld/
make
```

and run it with `clang` like this:

```bash
# Run the plugin
$LLVM_DIR/bin/clang -cc1 -load libHelloWorld.dylib -plugin hello-world test/input_for_hello.cpp
# Expected output
(clang-tutor) Hello from: Base1
(clang-tutor)  location: 3:  1
(clang-tutor)  number of bases classes 0
(clang-tutor) Hello from: Base2
(clang-tutor)  location: 6:  1
(clang-tutor)  number of bases classes 0
(clang-tutor) Hello from: Derived1
(clang-tutor)  location: 9:  1
(clang-tutor)  number of bases classes 1
(clang-tutor) Hello from: Derived2
(clang-tutor)  location: 12:  1
(clang-tutor)  number of bases classes 2
```

Building & Testing
===================
You can build **clang-tutor** (and all the provided plugins) as follows:
```bash
cd <build/dir>
cmake -DCT_LLVM_INSTALL_DIR=<installation/dir/of/clang/10> <source/dir/clang-tutor>
make
```

The `CT_LLVM_INSTALL_DIR` variable should be set to the root of either the
installation or build directory of Clang 10. It is used to locate the
corresponding `LLVMConfig.cmake` script that is used to set the include and
library paths.

In order to run the tests, you need to install **llvm-lit** (aka **lit**). It's
not bundled with LLVM 10 packages, but you can install it with **pip**:
```bash
# Install lit - note that this installs lit globally
pip install lit
```
Running the tests is as simple as:
```bash
$ lit <build_dir>/test
```
Voil√†! You should see all tests passing.

Overview of The Plugins
=======================
   * [**HelloWorld**](#helloworld) - prints the name, the location and number
     of base classes for each class declared the input module
   * [**LACommenter**](#lacommenter) - add comments for literal arguments in
     functions calls

Once you've [built](#build-instructions) this project, you can experiment with
every plugin separately. All plugins take C and C++ files as input.  All
plugins, except for [**HelloWorld**](#helloworld), are described below.

## LACommenter
The **LACommenter** (Literal Argument Commenter) plugin will comment literal
arguments in function calls. For example, in the following input code:

```c
extern void foo(int some_arg);

void bar() {
  foo(123);
}
```

the invocation of `foo` is commented as follows:

```c
extern void foo(int some_arg);

void bar() {
  foo(/*some_arg=*/123);
}
```

This commenting style follows LLVM's [oficial guidelines](
https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html#comment-formatting). **LACommenter**
will comment character, integer, floating point, boolean and string literal
arguments.

This plugin is based on a similar example from a
[presentation](https://s3.amazonaws.com/connect.linaro.org/yvr18/presentations/yvr18-223.pdf)
by Peter Smith.

### Run the plugin

```bash
$LLVM_DIR/bin/clang -cc1 -load lib/libLACommenter.dylib -plugin LAC test/LACLong.cpp
```

### Run the plugin through `lacommenter`

```bash
bin/lacommenter test/LACLong.cpp
```
